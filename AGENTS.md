# better_man_viewer

## Project Overview
Desktop + web viewer built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tauri.

## Mandatory Rules
- Run `pnpm verify` before merges.
- UI changes require smoke testing with both `pnpm dev` and `pnpm tauri dev`.
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.

## Tooling
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev`, `pnpm tauri dev`
- `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`
- `pnpm verify`
- `lefthook install`

## Quality Gates
- Test files: `*.test.ts` colocated with source.
